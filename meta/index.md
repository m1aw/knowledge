# META

Here I write stuff about this organizational system

## Downsides

- A bit anoying to test and deploy
- Not really easy for quick edits

## Limitations

- Can't have graph like linking. For example if I want to have a list of "Specialists" and also reference those "Specialits" in the Knowlage notes then I cannot do that.
- Doesn't automatly index these folders into the index (YET)
